        We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our AI companion app
        focused on end-to-end encryption (E2EE).

        <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul class="policy__list">
          <li>
            <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address or identifier
            provided by third-party authentication services (like Google Sign-In or Apple Sign-In). This is used solely for
            authentication and account management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User-Generated Content (End-to-End Encrypted):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Chat Messages:</strong> Your conversations with the iSolace AI companion are end-to-end encrypted.
                We <em>cannot</em> read your messages. They are encrypted on your device before being sent and decrypted
                only on your device(s).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User Story/Background:</strong> Any background information you provide ("Tell Us About Yourself")
                is also end-to-end encrypted before being stored. We <em>cannot</em> read this information.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to iSolace Premium, we receive verification data
            from the App Store or Google Play to confirm your subscription status (e.g., active, expired). We do not receive
            or store your payment card details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Data (Non-Personal):</strong> We may collect anonymous technical information, such as device
            type, operating system version, crash logs, and aggregated usage statistics (e.g., number of sessions started,
            feature usage). This data is used solely for improving app stability and user experience and is not linked to
            your personal identity.

        <h2 class="policy__section-title">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul class="policy__list">
          <li>
            <strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> Authenticate you, manage your account, sync your
            <em>encrypted</em> data across devices (if applicable), and process your subscription status.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Facilitate AI Interaction:</strong> Your <em>encrypted</em> chat messages and user story are processed
            by our backend systems solely to interact with the AI service provider (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI) and generate
            responses. The AI provider processes the data to generate responses but does not retain identifiable data associated
            with your account beyond the immediate processing needs (refer to the provider's privacy policy for details).
            Due to E2EE, we and the AI provider only process encrypted content for message history storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Process Payments:</strong> Verify your subscription status through secure tokens provided by Apple/Google.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Improve the App:</strong> Analyze anonymous technical data to identify bugs, improve performance, and
            understand how users interact with the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Communicate with You:</strong> Send important account-related notifications (e.g., subscription expiry).
            We will not send marketing emails without your explicit consent.
          </li>

        <h2 class="policy__section-title">3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul class="policy__list">
          <li>
            <strong>End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):</strong> Your chat messages and user story are protected by E2EE.
            Encryption and decryption keys are generated and stored securely on your device(s). We do not have access
            to your private keys and cannot decrypt your content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Server Storage:</strong> Encrypted data and account information are stored on secure servers managed by
            Google Firebase (Firestore). Non-personal technical data may also be stored on Firebase or other analytics platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your account

          We may share information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul class="policy__list">

              <li>Apple / Google (Authentication, Payment processing).</li>
            </ul>
            These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and are only permitted to use the information to provide services to us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith
            belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud,

          </li>

            <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You have the right to delete your account and associated data. This can typically be done
            through a "Delete Account" option within the App. Deleting your account will permanently remove your account information
            and encrypted content from our servers. Please note that due to E2EE, we cannot recover deleted content.

          <li>
            <strong>Encryption Key:</strong> You are responsible for managing your encryption key if a recovery phrase or backup mechanism
            is provided. Loss of the key may result in irreversible loss of access to your encrypted data.

          The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold depending on your jurisdiction,
          e.g., 16 in the EU). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected
